## Usage

If you want to find clothes, you don't even have to create an account. You can just search for the clothes you want and contact the seller with phone or email.

If you want to sell something, you first need to create an account. Then you can put out as many clothes as you want. There more information you add to your clothes, the higher chance of people finding your product.

With an account, you will also be able to save others clothing-ads in your favorite list to quickly find them again.
