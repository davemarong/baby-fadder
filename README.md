## General Information

If you have a playlist of songs on youtube, and some of the videos get taken down, all the information disappears. Unless you have a photographic memory, you will probably not remember the title of the song. That means you can't add the song again to your playlist. That is the reason why i created this extension. An easy and simple way to save the titles of those deleted videos.

As a father, I quickly fell into the trap of buying new clothes for my little one. After A few months, I decided to make an app to contribute to a solution. The main goal was to make it fast and simple to sell and buy used children clothes online.

## Usage

If you want to find clothes, you don't even have to create an account. You can just search for the clothes you want and contact the seller with phone or email.

If you want to sell something, you first need to create an account. Then you can put out as many clothes as you want. There more information you add to your clothes, the higher chance of people finding your product.
